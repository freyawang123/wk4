## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library("here")

```{r}
#select columns

library(tidyverse)
GenderInequality<-myscv1 %>%
  dplyr::select(c(1,2, 621, 612))

#select rows

GenderInequality<-GenderInequality[1:196,]
```

# read my shapefile
```{r}

```

  merge(.,
        GenderInequality,
        by.x="ISO3", 
        by.y="iso3",
        all.x=TRUE)
